<h1>Entertainment Robot</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Given the rise of COVID-19 cases, it’s essential that both kids and parents stay in quarantine to prevent the spread of the virus. In order to keep them from visiting friends and not social distancing, parents need a way to entertain the kids, even as they work from home.
The objectives of our team to address this issue was to create a distraction for kids that is entertaining so parents don’t have to be with them at all times and can work from home. Additionally, our team also aimed to keep people inside and enforcing quarantine with limited interactions.

<h2>Product Description: </h2>
● Wires were cleaned up and shorter wires were used as this was a safety hazard for little kids. </br>
● The motors were glued to the cardboard to make the robot more sturdy. </br>
● The batteries, breadboards and red boards were glued to make use of space as effective as possible. </br>
● The robot worked successfully, the piano game worked very consistently and we added more buttons than anticipated. </br>
● A limitation of the robot was definitely the wagon that it was pulling as in uneven surfaces it tended to be a bit unstable. </br>
